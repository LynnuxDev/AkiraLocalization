# Localization Guide for Akira

Welcome to the Akira's localization Repo! We use **Crowdin.com** for managing translations, and this repo contains the main files that should **not** be modified directly.

## Important Information

- **Do Not Edit These Files**: The files in the `/main` branch (like `/bot/commands.yml`) are the source files and should not be modified manually. All translation efforts should go through Crowdin.
- **/i182-main Branch**: The `/i18n-main` branch is exclusively for tracking the bot's internationalization process and **must never be touched**.

## How to Contribute

If you'd like to contribute translations to the project, follow these steps:

1. **Join Crowdin.com**: We manage all translations on Crowdin, a platform that makes it easy to collaborate on localization. You can contribute by joining the project at the following link:

   [Contribute Translations on Crowdin](https://crowdin.com/project/lynnuxdevAkira)

2. **Submit Translations**: Once you're in Crowdin, you'll find the files and strings that need translations. Please use the provided interface to add or improve translations for different languages.

3. **Testing and Feedback**: You can test your translations by downloading the Crowdin output and running it locally to see how the bot behaves in different languages. Make sure everything looks correct before submitting final translations.

p.s. tags can be used in translations, see [tags.md](./tags.md)

## Why Use Crowdin?

We use Crowdin for localization to:
- Ensure translations are managed centrally and reviewed consistently.
- Make it easy for contributors to work on translations without the risk of modifying critical files in the project repository.
- Track the progress of each language and keep the project organized.

## Final Note

Please remember:
- **Never edit files directly** in the repository for translations. All changes should be made via Crowdin.
- **Do not touch the `/i18n-main` branch** — it’s reserved for tracking and should remain untouched at all times.

Thank you for helping make Akira be more accessible to users around the world!
